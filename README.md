**Game is in progress.** This is open to ANYONE to play the next move. That's the point. wave: It's your turn! Put a 'X'.

**How this works**

When you click a link, it opens a GitHub Issue with the required pre-populated text. Just push 'Create New Issue'. That will trigger a [GitHub Actions](https://github.blog/2020-07-03-github-action-hero-casey-lee/) workflow that'll update my GitHub Profile _README.md_ with the new state of the board.


**Notice a problem?**

Raise an [issue](https://github.com/timburgan/timburgan/issues), and include the text _cc @timburgan_.
